# Advanced Cloud Native Go [Video]
This is the code repository for [Advanced Cloud Native Go [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/advanced-cloud-native-go-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787286238), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Go is a modern cross-platform programming language that is very powerful yet simple; it is an excellent choice for microservices and cloud applications. Go is gaining more and more popularity, and becoming an attractive skill as well.

In this video you will start with diving into the anatomy of cloud native application platform with its key functions. Here you will implement an advanced Go microservice using one of the frameworks, containerize and compose it using Docker, and finally deploy and orchestrate the service using Kubernetes. After that you will be introduced to Consul as the infrastructure component used throughout the course. You will learn to add service registration capabilities to a Go microservice and implement service lookup and configuration on the client side. You will also implement a modified version that uses Kubernetes only service discovery and configuration mechanisms. Next, you will briefly discuss the two major communication patterns with their pros and cons. You will then implement synchronous RPC style communication using a binary protocol such as ProtoBuf and apply a circuit breaker for resiliency. Finally, you will also implement two different forms of asynchronous communication in Go using RabbitMQ or Kafka as a message-oriented middleware.

By the end of this video tutorial, you will be well versed with building an advanced, robust, and scalable Go Microservices that are deployable to the cloud.
